Constrained optimization problems arise in numerous domains, from scheduling and logistics to financial planning and resource allocation. By incorporating Generative AI (GenAI) into these complex decision-making tasks, organizations can enhance efficiency, scalability, and adaptability. However, leveraging GenAI in constrained optimization scenarios requires strategic design and implementation to balance accuracy, speed, and reliability.

In this article, we will outline best practices for using GenAI in constrained optimization, using a real-world example: an AI-powered college course scheduling solution. We will also explore other applications, such as workforce scheduling, supply chain management, and portfolio optimization.

## Understanding Constrained Optimization in AI

Constrained optimization involves finding the best solution to a problem while satisfying a set of predefined constraints. These constraints could be based on rules, resources, dependencies, or preferences. Traditional optimization techniques, such as linear programming, evolutionary algorithms, and constraint satisfaction solvers, have long been used for these problems. However, GenAI introduces new capabilities, including:

- **Dynamic adaptability**: AI can adjust recommendations based on real-time inputs.
- **Improved decision support**: AI enhances human decision-making rather than replacing it.
- **Enhanced automation**: AI reduces manual effort in complex tasks.

However, successfully integrating GenAI into constrained optimization requires careful consideration of trade-offs, architecture choices, and mitigation of potential failures.

## Real-World Example: AI-Powered Course Scheduling

Let‚Äôs consider a specific scenario ‚Äì **AI-assisted scheduling for college courses** ‚Äì to illustrate concepts, implementation, and best practices for solving a constrained optimization problem with **Azure OpenAI o-series reasoning models**. 

For this use case, GenAI can help recommend courses based on major, course prerequisites, student data, and student preferences. The following architecture illustrates implementing a course scheduling system with a multi-agent solution, leveraging the **Reflection pattern** outlined here: [Microsoft AutoGen Reflection](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/core-user-guide/design-patterns/reflection.html).

The following architecture diagram illustrates an example implementation of this solution, where Azure SQL Database is leveraged to store student information and course data.

> üîé **Note:** Real-world optimization scenarios often involve many more constraints than those shown in simplified examples. For demonstration and Proof of Concept purposes, it is recommended to start with a scoped problem that highlights the most impactful variables and constraints. This approach accelerates learning and allows stakeholders to evaluate solution viability before expanding to full production complexity.


### 1. User Query
The student provides details such as their major, number of courses they want to take, and preferences (e.g., _‚ÄúI am a computer science major, and I'd like to take 3 major courses and 1 elective next semester. I prefer morning and in-person courses‚Äù_).

### 2. Scheduling Agent
The student‚Äôs request gets routed to the first agent, which queries a datastore for available courses. With the appropriate grounding data, the agent sends the student query and courses to **Azure OpenAI** to generate a course schedule.

#### System Message:
```
You are a scheduler. You recommend a student's schedule based on the courses provided.
Work with the reviewer to ensure your proposed schedule has no conflicts and aligns with the student's major and preferences.

If there is no course combination that work, do not make up courses or times.
Respond that you cannot meet the requirements, provide a reason, and suggest alternative courses.
```

### 3. Reviewer Agent
To ensure accuracy and that there are no course conflicts while adhering to student preferences, the reviewer agent considers the proposed schedule and sends feedback to the scheduling agent. The reviewer may either approve or request a revision to the schedule while providing feedback to the scheduler.

#### System Message:
```
You are a schedule reviewer. You ensure there are no time conflicts in the schedule created by the scheduler agent.

You fact check the proposed course names, days, and times against the data provided to ensure validity.

Try to ensure the student's preferences are taken into consideration, but prioritize conflicts and accuracy first.

Respond using the following JSON format: 
{ 
    "approval": "<APPROVE or REVISE>", 
    "suggested_changes": "<Your comments>" 
}
```


### 4. Design Trade-offs
- **Model Selection**: While **GPT-4o** produces faster results, **o3-mini** outperforms GPT-4o in constrained scheduling tasks, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.
- **Predefined SQL queries vs. AI-generated queries**: Since this system is fairly static, predefined SQL queries ensure higher accuracy and lower latency compared to AI-generated queries. However, in a more dynamic system, an additional **Course Retriever Agent** could be used to generate SQL queries dynamically.

## Best Practices for Using GenAI in Constrained Optimization

### 1. Select the Right AI Model for Constrained Optimization
- Use **AI models optimized for reasoning tasks** rather than purely generative tasks.
- Experiment with different models to balance **accuracy and performance**.
- Consider models that explicitly handle constraints well, such as **Azure OpenAI‚Äôs o-series**.

### 2. Use Prompt Engineering to Minimize Errors
- AI models tend to **hallucinate** when constraints make the problem infeasible.
- Explicitly instruct AI to **acknowledge constraints** and suggest alternatives rather than fabricating results.
- **Example prompts**:
  - _"Do not generate new data. If constraints are too strict, indicate no valid solution exists and provide alternatives."_
  - _"Validate all outputs against predefined constraints before returning results."_

### 3. Keep It Simple: Leverage AI Only Where Needed
- If **SQL queries** or other deterministic methods can solve part of the problem efficiently, use them instead of AI.
- AI should **augment structured logic, not replace it unnecessarily**.
- **Example**: For course scheduling, predefined **SQL queries** for retrieving prerequisite-compatible courses ensure faster, more accurate results than AI-driven query generation.

### 4. Use Multi-Agent Architectures for Better Constraint Handling
- Split complex optimization tasks between specialized agents:
  - **Proposal Agent**: Generates initial solutions.
  - **Validation Agent**: Ensures feasibility and compliance.
- This reduces the likelihood of errors and ensures that AI follows structured logic.

### 5. Monitor AI Performance and Adjust Strategies
- Test different **models and approaches** to balance **latency and accuracy**.
- AI responses should be **auditable** to understand why specific decisions were made.
- Continuous monitoring prevents AI from **getting stuck in loops** or generating infeasible solutions.

## Additional Examples of Constrained Optimization

### 1. Workforce Scheduling
- **Constraints**: Employee availability, labor laws, shift preferences, business hours.
- **Best Practice**: Combine AI recommendations with **rule-based verification** for compliance.

### 2. Supply Chain Management
- **Constraints**: Inventory levels, supplier lead times, demand forecasts, cost limits.
- **Best Practice**: Use AI to optimize for **multiple objectives** (cost vs. speed) while ensuring feasibility.

### 3. Portfolio Optimization
- **Constraints**: Risk tolerance, diversification requirements, liquidity needs.
- **Best Practice**: AI models can generate optimal allocations but should be constrained by **deterministic financial rules**.

## Conclusion

GenAI holds immense potential for constrained optimization across diverse industries. However, to maximize its effectiveness, organizations must:

- **Choose appropriate AI models** for the task.
- **Use prompt engineering** to minimize errors and hallucinations.
- **Integrate deterministic solutions** where applicable.
- **Structure AI-driven solutions** with multi-agent architectures.
- **Continuously monitor and refine AI performance**.

By following these best practices, businesses can harness AI‚Äôs power to solve complex optimization challenges **efficiently and reliably**. Whether in **education, workforce planning, or financial decision-making**, AI-driven constrained optimization can lead to **smarter, faster, and more scalable solutions**.
